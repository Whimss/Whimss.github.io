        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 text-left inline-block text-white">Professional Background</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-left mb-9" >Iâ€™m Alondra, a CSUN Computer Science graduate, who is passionate about frontend development focused on building accessible and user-friendly web apps.
          Most of my recent work involves React, Vite, and Firebase, and I'm currently trying to continue learning more frameworks and UI/UX techniques. I am also trying to
          grow as a backend developer to become a better and reliable fullstack programmer. Some languages I am familiar with are Java, Python, Html, Css,  and Javascript.
          Some frameworks, tools, and platforms I'm familar with are React, Vite, MongoDB, Firebase, and Jira.
          Although I may have not worked in a professional enviornment, a few of my soft skills that I believe are worth highlighting are my communication and collaboration skills that I have cultivated through
          working in general.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-left mb-6 text-center inline-block text-white">Who I Really Am </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-left mb-9">If I didn't have to speak professionally, I would say I'm just a first generation hispanic college graduate trying to make something of myself and trying to make my parents proud and their sacrifices mean something.
          I would also say I'm just a girl trying to somehow prove that I can hang and manage myself in a field mostly run by men. I may not be perfect or entirely great at something, but I know for a fact
          I will never give up or get discouraged in trying to make something happen or work because, I've made it this far being me.

            On the rare chance I have downtime, I make friendship bracelets for all my buddies.

          <li>
            Extra downtime, I spend volunteering for my old highschool's music department that I was department president for 2 years in a row so I have a soft spot for it.
          </li>
          <li>My most time consuming and favorite interest and hobby has to be caring for my pets.
